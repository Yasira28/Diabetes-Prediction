# Diabetes-Prediction
Welcome to the Diabetes Predictor repository! This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the data, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and management of diabetes.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized dataset to ensure high-quality input for the model.
Feature Engineering: Selected relevant features that significantly impact the prediction of diabetes.
Model Building: Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilized accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Visualization: Provided graphical representations of the data and model performance for better understanding and interpretation.
